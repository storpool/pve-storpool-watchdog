# StorPool HA watchdog replacement

PVE clusters offer a [High Availability](https://pve.proxmox.com/pve-docs/chapter-ha-manager.html) feature that automatically migrates virtual machines when their host loses connectivity to the cluster. As part of this functionality, a watchdog service monitors cluster status on each host, and fences it by rebooting the host when it has been disconnected from the cluster for a period of time.

Since StorPool relies on its own internal clustering mechanism it can remain unaffected by partitions in PVEâ€™s cluster, making these reboots undesirable, and potentially harmful with regards to storage performance and availability. To prevent such issues StorPool has developed a replacement watchdog service (sp-watchdog-mux), which stops any running virtual machines, and restarts only select services on the host.

For details on enabling the replacement watchdog service, see [Installing the StorPool Proxmox integration](https://kb.storpool.com/storpool_integrations/proxmox/install.html#pve-install).
